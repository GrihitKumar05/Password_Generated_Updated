This Password Manager is a simple and efficient Python application designed to securely generate, store, and retrieve passwords with ease. Built using tkinter for a clean graphical interface, it allows users to create strong random passwords, copy them instantly to the clipboard, and save credentials locally in a data.json file.

The app includes a built-in search function to quickly find stored credentials by website name and uses clear prompts to guide users through saving and retrieving data. With local storage and straightforward design, it offers a secure, offline solution for managing passwords without the complexity of cloud services or heavy databases.

Focusing on functionality and simplicity, this project demonstrates clean coding practices, practical UI design, and efficient data handling — making it a reliable tool for anyone who wants a password management solution that just works.
